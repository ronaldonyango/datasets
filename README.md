## Suicide Rates & Socioeconomic Factors (1990 - 2022)

- **Description**: The Suicide Rates & Socioeconomic Factors dataset delves into global suicide rates, demographics, and economic trends from 1990 to 2022. It provides a powerful tool to understand the complex relationship between suicide and various factors.

- **Download**: [Suicide Rates & Socioeconomic Factors Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ronaldonyango/global-suicide-rates-1990-to-2022/download)
- **Key Features**:
  - **Suicide Rates**: Includes data on suicide counts, percentages of total deaths by suicide, and both crude and age-standardized death rates per 100,000 population.
  - **Demographics**: Provides breakdowns by region, country, year, gender, age group, and even generation.
  - **Socioeconomic Indicators**: Explores economic factors like GDP, income levels (GNI), inflation, and employment rates.

**Understanding Age-Standardized Rates**:
You'll see two types of suicide death rates in this dataset:
- **Crude Death Rate per 100,000**: This shows the raw number of suicides per 100,000 people. However, it can be misleading because populations have different age structures. For example, a country with a larger elderly population might naturally have a higher crude death rate (from all causes, not just suicide) simply because older people are more likely to die.
- **Age-Standardized Death Rate per 100,000**: This is a more accurate comparison that adjusts for age differences between populations. It allows us to compare suicide rates across countries or over time while accounting for variations in age distribution.
By incorporating both types of rates, this dataset equips you to make more nuanced analyses of global suicide trends.
